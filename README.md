# MERN Game Store
## My very first fullstack project

* Based on Brad Traversy's Udemy course "MERN Stack - Front to Back", heavily modified to add e-commerce features
* MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express, Node, React
* Uses Redux for state management
* Uses Mongoose for additional back-end features
* Uses JWT for authentication
* ...and many other useful libraries...

## Some features
* User accounts & profiles
* Searching & filtering
* Developer info
* Shopping cart for adding multiple items

## Future plans / TODO:
This is the first version, there is still a lot of room for improvments.
