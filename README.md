# MERN Game Store
## My very first fullstack project

* Based on Brad Traversy's Udemy course "MERN Stack - Front to Back", heavily modified to add e-commerce features
* MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express, Node, React
* Uses Redux for state management
* Uses Mongoose for additional back-end features
* Uses JWT for authentication
* ...and many other useful libraries...

## Some features
* User accounts & profiles
* Searching & filtering
* Developer info
* Shopping cart for adding multiple items

## You can see it live here:

## Future plans:
**Redo this project using newer technologies - NextJS, Prisma, TypeScript**
